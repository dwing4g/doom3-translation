ECOM personnel on the 107 team had seen the analysis. In a situation where a conduit is considered lost, MMCA has responsibility in the MCS to coordinate determining the affected hardware parallel to the conduit.\n\nSince the analysis had determined there would not be burn-through, MMCA was not called to begin the process of assessing affected equipment. MMCA personnel discussed the analysis with DAB personnel who said they had seen the analysis from the MMT and did not consider it to be a concern."

Testing for today has been halted due to increased power fluctuations, however Ian thinks he can bypass the failsafes to boost our throughput, giving us the necessary power to move ahead with the final phase of Test 11. He is currently working on the problem in MC Routing. I am going to security to seal this area until testing can resume."
	"#str_03280"	"The research subjects continue to deteriorate mentally. I have requested a security guard onsite. I am beginning to question my own safety working in close proximity to the them. Test Subject 8 never stops screaming. I have informed the guard that offices occupied by the subjects are to be locked at all times. I asked Dr. Brasky to place some military supplies in the security room locker, if things get out of hand again I want to be ready."
	"#str_03281"	"Test Subject 4 attacked an inspector today. I want to know who was responsible for letting them into the rec area, especially when it was known that non-UAC personnel were coming through today. The last thing we needed was another accident. Betruger assured me that no report would be filed, but until we block these inspectors from entering secure areas we risk exposure.

Again, I suggest halting experimentation on these subjects until we discover what is affecting them."
	"#str_03287"	"We sent the first batch of volunteers through the teleporter today. Subjects were administered a mild anesthesia to put them under for the duration of the experiment. They reported no side effects when awakened, and the only reported injury was subject #7 who had several lacerations after recombination on the receiving pad. We have speculated they were somehow self-inflicted during matter transference, but are unable to fully explain how physical damage could be administered during an instantaneous transfer."

I know this proposal will come to you as a surprise because we have not met before either physically or through correspondence. I got your contact from our chamber of commerce here in Nigeria and have no doubt in your ability to handle this proposal involving huge sum of money. My father Chief Isama OKONKWO. (Now Late) was the Royal Head of my community, ELEME (an oil rich town) in Nigeria. My community produces 5.8% of the total crude oil production in Nigeria and 0.5% of the Dollar value of each barrel is paid to my father as royalty by the Federal Government. My father was also the Chairman of ISAMA Special Oil Trust Fund. In his position as the Royal head and Chairman of the Oil Trust Fund, he made some money which he left for me as the only heir to inherit.\n\nThe money is Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars(US$18.5). This Money originated from the accumulated royalties between 1976-1998 . Due to poor banking system in Nigeria and political instability as a result of past Military rules (1985-1999) , he deposited this Money in a Strong Room/VAULTS with an open beneficiary in a security company pending when he would finish arrangement to transfer it abroad . He was planning this when he died late last year of Heart Attack.\n\nJust before my father died he called my attention to the money and charged me to look for a foreigner who would assist me in the transfer/investment of the funds abroad. So l would be very grateful if you could accept to help me achieve this great objective. I promise to give you 25% of the total funds transferred to your vital bank account as compensation for your assistance. Five percent (5%)has been set aside to take care of all expenses we may incur during the transaction. To indicate your interest, contact me urgently and confidentially for more information and the roles you will play in this business.\n\nAll the legal Documents concerning this Money will be sent to you as soon as we agreed together. Please I will appreciate that you send your telephone/fax numbers to enable me contact you immediately for discussions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJohn Okonkwo\n"

You've been designated as our official representative in this matter and we suggest full preparation begin today.\n\nWe expect a complete appraisal of all research developments. Both current and future directions must be brought inline with the Board's expectations.  We must be able to control Dr. Betruger.  His extra-dimensional research is a potential risk to the teleportation experimentation, which we can not afford.  The Board considers teleportation the UAC's single most important scientific endeavor and is not willing to jeopardize it's dominance in this area of research.\n\nAnticipate a formal briefing and itinerary in the next few days.\n\nSincerely,\nUAC Board Chairman"

I've also learned that I've been reassigned by Dr. Betruger to a post back on Earth.

Having already collected many of the smaller 'Imp' creatures, we would like to bring back one of the larger ones, described by others as a 'Hell-Knight'.  Previous expeditions have reported seeing them at the Main Portal destination, where you will be arriving.  You will have several weapons with you, but we ask that you attempt to use non-lethal force, we would really like to have a live specimen if possible.\n\nFinally, traveling through the portal has caused varied reactions.

That changed today.\n\nI witnessed two of our guys doing maintenance on a bot in Mars City.  While having it only partially assembled, they activated its sensors to test their repairs.  All of the sudden, the Sentry locked onto one of the marines as an enemy and began firing at him.  If the ammo had been loaded, that marine would have been killed.  Thankfully the other marine was able to immobilize it quickly.\n\nThe Sentry Bot is powerful - but maybe too powerful.  Why do we need that much firepower in Mars City?  Except for the odd report of individuals going a little crazy, we don't have many problems.  Do we really expect the Sentry Bots to know the difference between someone having a bad day and someone gone mad?\n\nI hope you can talk to Sarge about this before something worse happens.\n-PFC Hagar"

It is difficult to be away from friends and family for so long and we all miss Earth's blue skies, green grass, and most of all, breathable fresh air.\n\nHowever, the opportunity we have here is historic. I believe we are on the precipice of an archeological find of profound proportions that will forever change not only our view of Mars and the ancient civiliztion that once inhabited it, but also how we see ourselves in the cosmos.\n\nLike all things worthwhile, this expedition will not be easy but we will do everything we can to make it as pleasant and safe as possible. Please adhere to all safety procedures that were presented in-flight and report any problems or issues immediately to your supervisors.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Elizabeth McNeil"

Just recently, one of our engineers, Peter, got crushed by a falling brick - yup those huge stones lining the entire wall and ceiling of the Ruins!\n\nSome of the guys are mumbling about the walls being alive or something, but you and I know it's just the horizontal stretching of the regional tectonic stresses.

It is a fascinating artifact and as it turns out, it has some amazing properties. I wrote a new glyph pattern query yesterday and let it run all night. With the new query, the linguistics computer finally cracked the remaining glyphs!\n\nThe Soul Cube is by every definition a weapon, and it seems to have been built to repel whatever type of creatures invaded this ancient culture. If I am reading them right, during a battle the cube gains power with each life the wielder takes. When it is fully charged it can be used to slay even the strongest of creatures. Even more impressive is that when it kills a creature it transfers that creature's life force back to who is using the cube!\n\nI know this sounds like magic and I have not been able to activate it to prove the theory but this is what the glpyhs illustrate.\n\nThe glyphs specifically point out that you must kill five creatures before it becomes charged and then amazingly it will tell you it is ready. It is almost like a sentient being; this object is a fantastic find.\n\nIan McCormick\n\ncc: Research Archive Storage"

	"#str_loadtip_2"	"Use the Grabber to deflect enemy projectiles back at them."
	"#str_loadtip_3"	"The Shotgun does greater damage at closer distances.  One shot will take out most enemies at very close range."
	"#str_loadtip_4"	"The BFG-9000 is devastatingly powerful when the shot is fully charged."
	"#str_loadtip_5"	"Running low on health, armor or ammunition?  Try exploring the environment for stashes."
	"#str_loadtip_6"	"Conserve your flashlight for when you truly need it.  You don’t want to run out of power mid fight."
	"#str_loadtip_7"	"Switch your weapons every now and then to save ammo for a weapon that could be useful later on. "

	"#str_loadtip_15"	"The Soulcube kills its target instantly.  It also restores the player’s health."
	"#str_loadtip_16"	"Smaller enemies are weak, but harder to hit. Use spread weapons like the Machine Gun to take them out quickly."
